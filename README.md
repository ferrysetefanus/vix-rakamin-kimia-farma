In this Virtual Internship Experience program, I was given an overview of how a Big Data Analyst works at Kimia Farma. I also learned how to solve problems and work on projects in accordance with Kimia Farma's company activities.

At the beginning, I was exposed to several reading and video learning materials that were expected to help me re-understand the competencies needed by a Big Data Analytics as well as understand how Kimia Farma applies this knowledge. Then I was challenged to complete several tests to review my understanding in the field of Business Intelligence. Finally, I was faced with the final project where I will be challenged to implement all the development-related knowledge that my friends have mastered before.
